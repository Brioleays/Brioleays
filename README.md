# 👋 Hi, I'm BRIOLEAYS

> *"In the middle of chaos, I build clarity through code."*

I'm a passionate, curious, and evolving developer driven by the desire to **master technology across multiple dimensions**. My journey combines design, frontend mastery, deep learning, and even quantum computing — and I document every step right here.

## ☕ Legacy in Progress

This isn't just about learning how to code.  
It's about designing a **life of impact** — one that’s intentional, creative, and technically excellent.
